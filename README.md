Fake news, one of the biggest new-age problems has the potential to  mould opinions and influence decisions.

The existing systems are inefficient in  giving a precise statistical rating for any given news claim. Also, the  restrictions on input and category of news make it less varied. This  report proposes a system that classifies unreliable news into different  categories after computing confusion matrix. This system aims to  use various machine learning techniques to help achieve maximum  accuracy. Keywords: Tfidf Vectors, Naive Bayes classifier , Passive  Aggressive Classifier
